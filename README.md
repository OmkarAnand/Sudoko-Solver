# Sudoko-Solver
This project is a Sudoku solver implemented in C++. It uses a backtracking algorithm to solve any given 9x9 Sudoku puzzle efficiently. The program checks for valid number placements based on Sudoku rules and recursively attempts to fill the board, ensuring that the solution is correct.
